# Generate-Outcomes-
a Python application that generates results based on statistics and news

We utilize two APIs to obtain data: NewsAPI for news data and a fictitious statistics data API for statistical data. We build two methods that use these APIs to obtain data and then select a random article and statistic to use in creating the result. Lastly, we publish the result by combining the random article's title with the most recent value of the random statistic.
